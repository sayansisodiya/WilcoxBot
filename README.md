# WilcoxBot (Created May 2020)
WilcoxBot is a Discord bot I created in high school to help my schoolmates manage online learning during COVID-19. The resources students needed were decentralized and unorganized, so I wrote this bot to provide students with easy access to those resources (Google Meet links, bell schedules, teachersâ€™ office hours, etc.) from any device.

You can find a more in-depth introduction to and demonstration of WilcoxBot on [its website](https://wilcoxbot.weebly.com/)!

P.S. I wrote this bot a while ago, so the code is rudimentary and inefficient in many places-- don't judge too hard :).
